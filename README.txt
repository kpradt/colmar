Project summation:
  Coding and designing responsive landing page
  for fictional school based on wireframes provided
Project notes:
  * I created two responsive breaks rather than only one, the first at 780px and the second at 640px. At the first break, I made the designed changes in the header and the last full section (Thesis Exhibits), both of which had begun to look crowded at that size; the rest of the designed changes looked loose and sloppy at that width.
  * I largely attempted to remain faithful to the wireframes, but there were a couple of places where the given dimensions looked terrible, most notably the 423px assigned to the right side of the second section.
